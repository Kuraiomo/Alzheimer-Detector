# Alzheimer-Detector
The Alzheimer's Detection Model uses deep learning to classify MRI images into four categories: **MildDemented**, **ModerateDemented**, **NonDemented**, and **VeryMildDemented**. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, it leverages CNN architectures and processes data through resizing, normalization, and augmentation for accurate and early diagnosis.
