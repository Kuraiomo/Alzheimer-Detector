### Alzheimer's Detection Model Summary

The Alzheimer's Detection Model is designed to classify MRI images into four categories: **MildDemented**, **ModerateDemented**, **NonDemented**, and **VeryMildDemented**, using deep learning techniques. 

The dataset is organized into training and testing directories:
- **Training Path**: `/content/Data/Train/` (subfolders: `MildDemented`, `ModerateDemented`, `NonDemented`, `VeryMildDemented`)
- **Testing Path**: `/content/Data/Test/` (same subfolder structure).

During preprocessing, images are resized and normalized, and data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance model robustness. The model employs **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, using CNN-based architectures such as **VGG16**, **ResNet**, or custom models tailored for optimal performance. Transfer learning is utilized to leverage pre-trained weights, improving accuracy and reducing training time. The final layer of the model uses a **softmax activation function** to classify images into the four categories.

The training process incorporates techniques like **early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling** to prevent overfitting and improve convergence. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, with confusion matrices and loss/accuracy plots used for detailed analysis.

The trained model can be deployed as a web or mobile application using frameworks like Flask or TensorFlow Serving, enabling real-world usability for early Alzheimer's detection.
